        If you own the <b>Pro Version</b> you can hold your finger at a location on the map and create a new Fishing Spot right there. So, you can use the map to search for new hidden spots and mark them right in Fishie! Then next time your out - check Fishie to see if you're near any fishing holes. 
    </div>

    <div class="help-section"> 
        <b>Tip:</b> When you go to the details on a Fishing Spot tap the <b>share</b> button to get driving directions to that spot, or you can send the Location URL to one of your fishing buddies.
