            We've released "Shelley" back into the water. Now let's measure her. I measured the distance between the red lines on my spin rod and added that information by tapping the pencil icon in the upper right.<br/>
            Drag the two grab bars so that the two lines line up at the ends of the known item (in this case the red-to-red distance is 2.75 inches) - the distance for the whole width of the photo is then 12.73 inches.

            If the fish doesn't take up the width of the photo you can pinch the photo to zoom in till it does.

            When you tap the pencil you'll see a list of object measurements. You can add your own or edit anything.

            When you're all done - tap the Done button and you can accept the width and estimated weight shown. The weight estimate uses a complex algorithm that assumes a medium sized bass. You can always override these values by tapping the edit button.
