            First the hard part: <b>catch a fish!</b> Then take at least one picture with the fish horizontal on the ground with some known object in the photo. In this case I'm using my Ugly Stik<sup>&reg;</sup> GX2<sup>&trade;</sup> spinning rod.
            <img class="img-responsive" src="/img/fish-measure-1.jpg"/>
            Tap the 'fish measure' button.

                <b>Step 1:</b> I've already added the name and width of a portion of my Ugly Stik<sup>&reg;</sup> (I'm using the distance between the two red lines which is 2.75 inches). 
            </p>
            <p> 
                To add a new item, just tap the 'New Item Name' field and type in the name, then add the width of that item in inches in the next field.
            <p>
            <p>
                <b>NOTE:</b> This item will be saved and next time will show up in the picker list.
            </p>
            <p> 
                Tap 'Set' when you're ready.

            <p>
                <b>Step 2:</b> Now drag the two handles so that the vertical lines mark the left and right edges of the item. In this case I'm using the two red lines on the rod. 
            </p>
            <p>
                <b>HINT:</b> You can zoom into the photo to get a closer look using a pinch-out gesture on the photo.
            </p>
            <p> 
                Tap 'Set' when you're ready.

            <p>
                <b>Step 3:</b> Now drag the two handles so that the vertical lines mark the left and right edges of the fish and you'll see the length and weight estimate change as you drag.
            </p>
            <p>
                <b>HINT:</b> If the fish was moving it's tail or something, you can always add a little on one side to compensate.
            </p>
            <p> 
                Tap 'Set' when you're happy with everything to save these settings.

            <p>
                <b>NOTE:</b> This fish was actually weighed with a scale at 2.8 pounds - so Fishie Ruler can be quite accurate!
