    <h1 class="text-center">Welcome to Fishie</h1>
        
    <p>
        I hope you like it. I developed Fishie out of my love for fishing!

    <p>
        Fishie will need access to the <strong>Camera</strong> and your <strong>Photos</strong>
    </p>

    <p>
        Fishie also needs access to your <strong>Location</strong> to help you track your catches
    </p>

    <p>
        Just tap <strong>Allow</strong> on the authorization popups
    </p>
