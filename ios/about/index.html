    <h1 class="text-center">About Fishie</h1>

    <p>
        <strong>Hello!</strong> Fishie was developed by me, Jef Armstrong, out of my love for fishing. The idea started simply as just a better camera for taking fish pictures and grew from there.

        There are some people I need to thank.
    </p>
    <p>
        First - my wife G.G. for supporting me, encouraging me and putting up with all the "field testing" that went into making Fishie.
    </p>
    <p>
        Also, it was her inspiration that lead to the fish naming feature. She would always ask me what where the names of the fish I caught, so I built that into Fishie. Now, everytime I catch a fish I can't wait to see what it's name is.
    </p>
    <p>
        I'd like to thank my fishing buddy Evan who also gave me much inspiration and ideas for Fishie.
    </p>

        A big shoutout to Mike Hsiao of <strong>@1rod1reelfishing</strong> fame! It was soon after getting 2nd place in his New Jersey tournament that Fishie was born. Plus you can hear Mike's enthusiastic "Fish On" yell everytime you tap the Fishie 'Fish On' button.

        Thanks to Mikey Sabadic (<strong>@island_life_252</strong> on Instagram) for the awsome photos used in Fishie.
