    <h1 class="text-center">About Fishie</h1>

    <p>
        <strong>Hello!</strong> Fishie was developed by me, Jef Armstrong, out of my love for fishing. I started with the simple idea of creating a better camera for fish pictures and the app grew out of that. As I "field tested" Fishie (that's what you get to call 'going fishing' when you are developing a fishing app), I added features that me and my fishing buddies needed.

        <h3>Thanks</h3>
        There are some people I need to thank.
    </p>
    <p>
        First - my wife G.G., my daughter and my dog Chucho for supporting me, encouraging me and putting up with all the "field testing" that went into making Fishie.

        Also, it was her inspiration that lead to the fish naming feature. She would always ask me what where the names of the fish I caught, so I built that into Fishie. Now, everytime I catch a fish I can't wait to see what it's name is.

        I'd like to thank my fishing buddy Evan who also gave me much inspiration and ideas for Fishie.

        A big shoutout to Mike Hsiao of <a href="youtube://user/1rod1reelfishing"><strong>@1rod1reelfishing</strong></a> fame! It was soon after getting 2nd place in his New Jersey tournament that Fishie was born. Plus you can hear Mike's enthusiastic "Fish On" yell everytime you tap the Fishie 'Fish On' button.
