    - 1000 fish names included
    - See if you can catch them all

  When I caught a fish my wife would ask me,<br/>
  "What was it's name?" 
  <br/>
  I didn't have an answer, so I added automatic fish naming to Fishie and now I can tell her "I caught ol' Blue."
  <br/>

  It makes remembering and sharing your catches so much more fun!
